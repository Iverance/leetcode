#
# Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings),
# and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are
# similar.
# 
# For example, words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"] and words2 = ["fine",
# "drama", "talent"] are similar, if the similar word pairs are pairs =
# [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], 
# ‚Å†["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
# 
# Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if "great" and
# "good" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and
# "fine" are similar.
# 
# Similarity is also symmetric.  For example, "great" and "fine" being similar
# is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.
# 
# Also, a word is always similar with itself.  For example, the sentences
# words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, even though
# there are no specified similar word pairs.
# 
# Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of
# words.  So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2
# = ["doubleplus","good"].
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
# The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
# The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
# The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].
